# el.libertador
Just another arcade Space Invaders clone for android.


This is an attempt to make a Space Invaders game for android, by using free resources from the Internet. It started initially 
as a plain Java project, and afterwards took the decision to port the code to Android. The refactoring required to make an
Android project from a fully functional Java project, was surprisingly  small. Currently the present project is available for 
download at the Google Play market at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.libertadorgames.el_libertador&hl=en

Any proposal to improve the logic or the game overall would be fully appreciated.

Also, I am practically a noob to github so please be gentle.
